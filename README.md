- This a Sonarqube for analyzing code quality, identifying bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells for a sample angular node app.
- Integration with CI/CD: SonarQube integrated into CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Action) to automatically run code analysis with each commit or pull request. This ensures that code is consistently monitored for issues.
- Setup sonarqube on ec2 and connect it to the gitHub repo to send the result of gitaction to the sonarqube app.
